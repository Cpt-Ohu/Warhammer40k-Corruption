<!-- 1.) Second Heart / Organed
The very first stage in the process is the implantation of the Secondary Heart, normally between the age of ten and fourteen. 
This is capable of boosting the blood supply or sustaining full life functions even after 
the destruction of the recipient’s original heart. This implant enables Space Marines to 
survive low oxygen concentrations and traumatic injury, and is also necessary in the 
maintenance of the subject’s metabolism, which will be pushed to its limits as his body is
subject to the many surgical procedures it will endure over the next several years.

<!-- 2.) Ossmodula
The next stage in the implantation process is the addition of the Ossmodula.
This is a tube-shaped organ whose small size belies its complex structure. 
The Ossmodula monitors and secretes hormones affecting epiphiseal fusion and 
ossification of the skeleton. At the same time, the specially engineered hormones encourage 
the forming bones to absorb ceramicbased chemicals administered in the Neophyte’s diet. 
Two years following implantation, this will have caused considerable strengthening of 
the long bones, extreme ossification of the chest cavity (caused by growth of the ribs forming a solid mass of inter-laced bone plates),
and a general increase in the size of the recipient’s skeleton.

<!--  3.)  Biscorpea 
Normally implanted at the same time as the Ossmodula, the Biscopea is emplaced within the chest cavity. It is small, approximately spherical and, 
like the Ossmodula, its primary function is hormonal. The presence of the Biscopea stimulates muscle growth throughout the body. These muscles bond 
to the rapidly growing skeleton, which is why these two implants are often undergone at the same time.

<!--  4.) Haemastamen
Phases four and five are often implanted at the same time, between the ages of twelve and fourteen. The Haemastamen is a tiny organ, placed within a main blood vessel and serves
two main purposes. Firstly, it monitors and to some degree controls the Ossmodula and the Biscopea. It also alters the constituent make-up of the recipient’s blood. As a result, 
the Space Marine’s blood will be considerably more efficient than ordinary human blood, as it has to be considering the extra biological hardware the Space Marine carries inside him.

<!-- 5.) Larraman's Organ
The second implant emplaced at this time is the Larraman’s Organ. This is a liver-shaped, dark, fleshy organ. It is implanted into the chest cavity along with a complicated array of blood
vessels. The organ generates and stores special Larraman cells. If the recipient is wounded, these cells are released into the bloodstream, where they latch onto leucocytes in the blood
and are transported to the site of the wound. Once outside the body, the Larraman cells form a skin substitute of instant scar tissue, staunching the flow of blood and protecting any
exposed wound area. This process is almost instantaneous, and it can appear to the onlooker as if the blood is frozen solid even before it hits the ground.

<!-- 6.) Catalepsean Node 
With the initiation of phase six, the subject is ready to begin the extensive hypnotherapy that will continue throughout the entire initiation process, and beyond. The Catalepsean
Node is a brain implant usually inserted into the back of the skull via a hole drilled into the occipital bone. The pea-sized organ influences the circadian rhythms of sleep and the body’s
response to sleep deprivation. Normally, a Space Marine sleeps like any normal man, but if deprived of it, the Catalepsean Node becomes active. The recipient is capable of sleeping
and remaining awake at the same time by switching off areas of the brain sequentially. This process cannot replace normal sleep entirely, but it increases a Space Marine’s survivability by
allowing awareness of the environment whilst resting.

<!-- 7.) Preomnor 
The next three phases of the process, the implantation of the Preomnor, Omophagea and Multi-lung are often undertaken at the same time, between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. 
The Preomnor is a large implant which fits into the chest cavity. It is a pre-digestive stomach which allows the recipient to eat a variety of otherwise poisonous or indigestible materials. 
No actual digestion tales place in the Preomnor. Instead, individual sensory tubes assess potential poisons and neutralise them or, where necessary, isolate the Preomnor from the rest of the 
digestive tract.

<!-- 8.) Omophagea 
The Omophagea is a complicated implant that is placed within the spinal cord between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, where it becomes in effect part of the brain. 
Four nerve sheaths called neuroclea are implanted between the spine and the preomnoral stomach wall. The Omophagea is designed to absorb genetic material generated in animal tissue 
as a function of memory. This endows the Space Marine with an unusual survival trait—he can actually learn by eating. If a Space Marine eats part of a creature, he will absorb some of 
the memories of that creature. This can be very useful in an alien environment. Incidentally, it is the presence of this organ which has created the various flesh eating and blood drinking 
rituals for which many Chapters are known, as well as giving the names to Chapters such as the Blood Drinkers and Flesh Tearers.

<!--  9.) Multi-Lung Organized
The third organ implanted at this time is the Multi-lung. This large, tubular, grey organ is sometimes called the ‘third lung’. Blood is pumped through the organ
 via connecting vessels grafted onto the recipient’s pulmonary system. Atmosphere is taken in by means of a sphincter located in the trachea. 
 In toxic atmospheres, an associated sphincter muscle closes the trachea and restricts normal breathing, thus protecting the lungs. 
 The Multi-lung is able to absorb oxygen from poorly oxygenated or poisonous air without suffering damage thanks to its own efficient toxin dispersal, 
 neutralisation, and regeneration systems.

<!-- 10.) Occulobe 
Phase ten of the process is the implantation of the Occulobe. This small slug-like organ sits at the base of the brain. It provides the hormonal and genetic stimuli which enable a Space Marine’s 
eyes to respond to optic-therapy. The Occulobe does not in itself improve a Space Marine’s eyesight, but it allows technicians to make adjustments to the growth patterns of the eye and 
the light-receptive retinal cells. A Space Marine has far better eyesight than a normal human, and can see in low light conditions almost as well as in daylight.

<!-- 12.) Sus-an Membrane
Between the ages of fifteen and sixteen, phase twelve is initiated, in which a flat, circular organ called the Sus-an Membrane is implanted over the top of the exposed brain. It then grows 
into the brain tissue until completely merged. The organ is not effective until subsequent chemical therapy and training is applied. However, a properly tutored Space Marine may then enter 
into a state of suspended animation. This may be a conscious action, or may happen automatically in the event of extreme physical trauma. In this condition, a Space Marine may survive for
many years, even if bearing otherwise fatal injuries. Only appropriate chemical therapy and auto-suggestion can revive a Space Marine from this  state—he cannot revive himself. 
The longest known period of deanimation followed by successful reanimation is 567 years, in the case of Brother Silas Err of the Dark Angels Chapter.

<!-- 13.) Melanchromic Organ
The next phase of the process is the implantation of the Melanchromic Organ. This hemispherical, black organ functions in an indirect and extremely complex manner. It monitors radiation 
levels and types bombarding the skin, and if necessary, sets off chemical reactions to darken the skin and protect it from ultraviolet exposure. It also provides limited protection from 
other forms of radiation. Differing Melanchromic Organ gene-seed from Chapter to Chapter leads to variations in skin and hair colour, and in some Chapters all of the Space Marines may have 
identical colouration, such as is found in the albino warriors of the Death Spectres Chapter.

<!-- 14.) Oolitic Kidney organized 
Phases fourteen and fifteen, the implantation of the Oolitic Kidney and the Neuroglottis, are often undertaken at the same time. The Oolitic Kidney is red-brown and heart-shaped
and improves and modifies the Space Marine’s circulatory system, enabling other implants to function effectively. The Oolitic Kidney also filters blood extremely efficiently and
quickly. The Secondary Heart and Oolitic Kidney are able to act together, performing an emergency detoxification function in which the Space Marine is rendered unconscious as his
blood is circulated at high speed. This enables a Space Marine to survive poisons and gases which are otherwise too much for even the multi-lung to cope with.

In phase sixteen, normally at age sixteen, a small organ called the Mucranoid is implanted in the lower intestine where its hormonal secretions are absorbed by the colon.
These secretions initiate a modification of the sweat glands. This modification normally makes no difference to the Space Marine until activated by appropriate chemical therapy. As
a result of this treatment, the Space Marine sweats an oily, naturally cleansing substance which coats the skin. This protects the Space Marine against extremes of temperature
and even offers a slight degree of protection against vacuum. Mucranoid chemical therapy is standard procedure in long space voyages and when fighting in vacuum or near-vacuum.

Betcher’s Gland works in a similar way to the poison gland of venomous reptiles by synthesising and storing deadly poison. Space Marines are rendered immune to this poison by virtue
of the gland’s presence. The gland allows the Space Marine to spit a blinding contact poison, which is also highly corrosive.
A Space Marine imprisoned behind iron bars could easily chew his way out given a few hours.

<!-- 18.) Progenoids
 In the penultimate phase of the process, a pair of glands called Progenoids are implanted, one in the neck and the other deep in the chest cavity. 
This takes place between the age of sixteen and eighteen. These glands are vitally important to the very survival of the Space Marine’s Chapter. Each organ
grows within the Space Marine, absorbing hormonal stimuli and genetic material from the other implants. After five years, the neck gland is mature and ready for removal. 
After ten years, the chest gland becomes mature and is also ready to be removed. A gland may be removed any time after it has matured, and it represents 
the Chapter’s only source of geneseed. When mature, each organ contains a single gene-seed corresponding to each zygote implanted into the recipient.
Once removed by surgery, the Progenoid must be carefully prepared, its individual gene-seeds checked for mutation, and sound gene-seeds stored. 
Gene-seeds can be stored indefinitely under suitable conditions. Space Marine Apothecaries carry a special device known as a reductor, which they can use in 
battlefield conditions to remove the Progenoid glands of a fallen Space Marine, so that, even should he die before his glands are harvested, they may be recovered. 
The whole purpose of the Progenoid is to provide gene-seed to enable the Chapter to continue. It is not possible to create a zygote in any other way. Each Chapter’s
stock of gene-seed is therefore unique to itself. Gene-seed has a great deal of religious significance to a Chapter, representing its identity and future. Without gene-seed, 
a Chapter has no future. The extinction of a type of gene-seed means that a zygote has been lost forever. The extinction of the Progenoid gene-seed itself would effectively mean 
the end to a Chapter. As each Space Marine has only two Progenoid glands, the rate at which a Chapter can create new Space Marines is restricted. It may take many years 
for a Chapter to rebuild itself after heavy losses. Gene-seed is often rendered useless if a Space Marine is exposed to high radiation levels or other forms of genetic disturbance. 
The efficiency of different Chapters’ Progenoid gene-seed also varies, so some Chapters are able to make up their numbers faster than others.

<!-- 19.) Black Carpace
The final and the most distinctive implant is the Black Carapace, which cannot be implanted beyond the age of eighteen. This looks like a film of black plastic when growing
in the tanks. This is removed from its culture-solution and cut into sheets, which are implanted directly beneath the skin of the recipient’s torso. Within a few hours, the tissue 
expands, hardens on the outside, and sends invasive neural bundles deep inside the subject. After several months, the recipient is fitted with neural sensors and transfusion points, 
cut into the hardened carapace. These artificial interface points mesh with features integral to the power armour, such as the monitoring, medicinal, and maintenance units. 
Without the benefit of the Black Carapace, a Space Marine’s power armour would be far less effective

      <description>The final and the most distinctive implant is the Black Carapace, which cannot be implanted beyond the age of eighteen. This looks like a film of black plastic when growing in the tanks. This is removed from its culture-solution and cut into sheets, which are implanted directly beneath the skin of the recipient’s torso. Within a few hours, the tissue expands, hardens on the outside, and sends invasive neural bundles deep inside the subject. After several months, the recipient is fitted with neural sensors and transfusion points, cut into the hardened carapace. These artificial interface points mesh with features integral to the power armour, such as the monitoring, medicinal, and maintenance units.
